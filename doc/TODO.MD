# TODO

- delete photos
  - move to trash folder
  - remove from index.json
- rotate photos
- mouse toggle fullscreen (like F11)

Ingestion:

- escape hatch: if media is found without metadata, move it into a special folder

Other:

- test how much photos can be shrinked with avif encoding, but keeping all existing exif metadata
