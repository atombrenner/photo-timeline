# TODO

- reorg and normalize all existing media data

- read all photos and try to navigate

- escape hatch: if media is found without metadata, move it into a special folder

- find all videos without creation data

- try to convert every video to mp4 (experiment with transcoding if necessary)

- create issue snowpack not serving files with unicode characters

- duplicate detection and removal

- test how much photos can be shrinked with avif encoding, but keeping all existing exif metadata
